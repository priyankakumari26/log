Start at hairline and work inward until hair is thoroughly saturated. All lice and nits must be in contact with the spray. Allow hair to dry naturally, do not blow dry. Once dried, dead lice and nits may be removed with the nit comb. Hair may be washed / styled any time after it is dry, or you may leave product in the hair until the next time you would normally wash your hair.
